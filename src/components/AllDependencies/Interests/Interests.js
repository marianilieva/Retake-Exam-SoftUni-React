                    <h3>Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Work is a practice to earn money by doing what the person 
                        can. Money are used to buy things or services that someone needs 
                        but cannot do himself. In the past, when they were not known to the 
                        world, people did most of things in life by themselves - cook, build, 
                        plant, raise animals, etc. They used to barter when there was someting 
                        they couldn't do and needded help for. You give one you can and receive 
                        in return one you can't. It is not very clear if money are a good or a bad 
                        practice but they make sometimes living easier, other times they are 
                        bad influence for some of the people, so they must be used wisely: Money 
                        is not goal, it is tool!

                    <p>
                        Nowadays, life is not that easy. We have many possibilities 
                        but many responsibilities, too. Job is sometimes difficult to find 
                        so peope don't always work what they want or study what they work, or 
                        study what they want, or do what they can. Proffession is skill or skills 
                        which you study for and upgrade.
