                Everybody has the right to choose whether to live alone in 
                the forest or to share civilisation with others. Living alone 
                only with closest creatures is very calm and you can feel the 
                full stack of nature all around. But I think, if someone lives 
                like that for a long time, once he gets bored. You may not meet 
                people everyday, or not have much friends, but from time to time 
                a human being needs to communicate, some more, some less. People are 
                introvert or extrovert, or anything between but still, they have others 
                in their lives.

                    <h4>The Purpose of Life</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most important relationship in lifetime is between 
                        parents and children. Parent is the world and example which a 
                        human being sees first, which gives him feelings and 
                        understanding of all around, start and directions for 
                        life and which he is made of. All our lives depend on our 
                        parents, even before being born, the soul chooses its parents 
                        to live with and to brighten their lives. Children are born 
                        to make their parents' lives better, to teach them how to be happy 
                        and to heal them. We should learn from our children!

                    <h4>Family</h4>
                    <p>
                        Family is not only mother, father and baby, but also grandparents, uncles, 
                        aunts, cousins, etc. It includes connected people, not as close as the closest 
                        but most have the same blood, have grown up in the same environment, have 
                        common things, or common thinking. Family is very important thing in life 
                        because these are people who understand each other, help and support each 
                        other. And you know them even when you don't spend much time with them. 
                        There are families who make wars inside them but this is very wrong because 
                        those who are strong, this is not sure how long will continue, and those 
                        who are weak, the family is the first who must help, especially in today's 
                        world. Value your families!

                    <p>
                        Frinds are like a second family which a person choses himself. It must 
                        be filtered wisely and by common interests, beliefs, character traits.

                    <h4>Living Spot</h4>
                    <p>
                        In USA there are regions for live to chose. People 
                        know that every neighbourhood and town has their own 
                        laws and habits, so they select the people they live among 
                        and rules they obbay. They are not always written rules but known 
                        so that nobody makes unneeded bariere to somebody else. In Bulgaria 
                        there is no such official division because it is a small country but 
                        people can still investigate and chose their spot for living.

                    <p>
                        People spend most of the time with colegues or communicating 
                        with them. They are important part of mental stability and must 
                        be chosen, too. Usually, when sharing common interests and skills, 
                        they share common intelligence.

                        country treated among others? What are your traditions 
                        and what do they represent? What legends and stories do you 
                        hear? All these are factors of life which influence your belies

                    <p>
                        It is very complicated thing and there are different 
                        thoughts about it. Some people worship it as life savior, 
                        others concideer it manipulation. One thing is for sure - 
                        there is a big difference between faith and religion. Not everybody 
                        has religion but everybody believes in something - nature, science, 
                        psychology or phylosophy, etc.
