                <p>
                    Many factors change people and it is easy to pass the limits.
                    Everybody has his own place in this world, his oppinion, his purpose 
                    in life, his qualities and weeknesses. But there are also outer situations 
                    which can change character and behavier - upbringing, belief, family, friends,
                    big changes in life, education, getting old, reading, living, etc. Change 
                    is the purpose of universe but it must not be outside good effects because 
                    when people forget who they are, what they are, and the normal way of Earth
                    spinning and people depending on it, then they start to feel incomfortability,
                    anger, pain, and finally stop feeling and forget what they want and what 
                    they dream about. Some even accept those things as normal and, maybe, they 
                    are, as long as they are symptoms of wrong direction, to fix it. Noone can 
                    actuelly tell what normal is but it is not harming others without justice for sure.
                    So, intuition is there to tell us if we are right or wrong, we just have to 
                    hear and understand it.
