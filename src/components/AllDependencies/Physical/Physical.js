            <p>
                Body is created of complicated communication between souls,
                energy and building blocks of substances. Sciense is studying
                this process more and more. In the past, only religious leaders
                were allowed to understand the High Powerand only healers were able
                to understand health. but times change, people evoluate. Now the
                unseen is not the mistery it was, as its relation with physical bodies
                in no longer secret.

                Human body has some systems and they all reflect the way
                of life. Heart manages all, it handles all body changes and
                reacts according to the needs of other organs to give them
                whatever they need with the blood, and to clean back all the
                garbage away in different ways. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Heart is very active and if it
                is not working OK, it means that rhythm of life is too fast, or opposite
                - too slow. We must live in the between, to keep the ballance between
                keeping the world living as it is, and change it to be stronger
                better and happier.

                Brain is responsible for the information moving inside the body
                outside as reaction to the environment and back to understand it.
                It has different parts to manage different body systems. Problems
                with brain appear when people has problems understanding and accepting
                situations.

                Brething system has the function to taka care of the air 
                which is a direct way to use gifts fo nature, communicate with her 
                and exchange "life". Gastrointestinal system is the other side who makes
                more complicated and more long-term processes. They both work in a parelel
                way in taking and giving. Health problems with any of them 
                means difficulties with communication with the world and environment.

                Senses are the helpers for everything else, they show us danger
                or safety, they help people make small changes, motivate themselves
                without making harm and show individuality mostly with art.
            </p>

                Health, accorging to the World Health Organisation means condition 
                of complete physical, mental and social well-being. To achieve
                it, people should keep the air, food, environment and relatioships
                clean, so that life goes a normal way. Thay need air, water, movement, food, 
                relaxation and sleep. People must also know that nature is 
                what we depend on and should keep its prosperity. There is one more thing
                that changed over time and has saved many creatures, including humans,
                alive - intuition, senses. If you feel the nature, the nature will feel you.
                Feelings give us information on reality, because it exists, no matter
                if they know it or no. Living in ballance is not an easy but worthy thing!
