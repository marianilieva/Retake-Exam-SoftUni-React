            <p>
                First of all, we depend on our health (which depends on 
                everything else). Our good physical condition makes our heart
                beats in a good rhythm, so that we could love the life we live;
                the feet run fast, so we can enjoy the Sun and wind; the body paths
                be clear for the blood, air and information pass calmly through them.
                Second, we need to live in a place where we feel good, and it helps
                our health. Some people love sun, other love snow, ant there are also
                people who enjoy dancing in the rain. So, everybody must be in his place
                which allows him be healthy and invest time in making social life better.
                People who we live among make big influence on our lives and it changes
                our health in a good or bad ways, our development as personalities, too.
                Most important are family and friends, after that - colegues and neighbours.
                And last but not least, the things we do are the people we are.
